Program Keys

For Programs which require keys to operate, Licensee may not have more keys to the Program in Licensee's Enterprise than Licensee has entitlements.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Authorized User

Authorized User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An Authorized User is a unique person who is given access to the Program. The Program may be installed on any number of computers or servers and each Authorized User may have simultaneous access to any number of instances of the Program at one time. Licensee must obtain separate, dedicated entitlements for each Authorized User given access to the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. An entitlement for an Authorized User is unique to that Authorized User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the Authorized User entitlement to another person.

Events Per Second (EPS)

100, 500, 1K, and 2.5K Events Per Second are units of measure by which the Program can be obtained. An event is a log event generated from a server, application or device that can be processed for a specific purpose. Sufficient entitlements must be obtained to cover the maximum number of Events Per Second to be collected and processed by the Program at any time.

Flows Per Minute (FPM)

10K, 25K, 50K, and 100K Flows Per Minute are units of measure by which the Program can be obtained. A Flow is a record of communications between two hosts. All of the packets that contain the same source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, and protocol are combined to become one Flow record. Sufficient entitlements must be obtained to cover the maximum number of Flows Per Minute at any time.

Managed Virtual Server

Managed Virtual Server is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate server. A virtual server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a physical server or an unpartitioned physical server. Licensee must obtain Managed Virtual Server entitlements for each virtual server managed by the Program.

Resource Unit

Resource Unit is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. Resource Unit is an independent measure of a resource managed by, processed by, or related to the use of the Program. Sufficient entitlements must be obtained to cover every resource managed by, processed by, or related to the use of the Program.

Virtual Processor Core

Virtual Processor Core is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Physical Server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate Physical Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a Physical Server or an unpartitioned Physical Server. A Processor Core is a functional unit within a computing device that interprets and executes instructions. A Processor Core consists of at least one instruction control unit and one or more arithmetic or logic units. A Virtual Processor Core is a Processor Core in an unpartitioned Physical Server, or a virtual core assigned to a Virtual Server. Licensee must obtain entitlements for each Virtual Processor Core made available to the Program.

Licensee can deploy the Program (if supported) using full capacity licensing, sub-capacity licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/subcaplicensing.html), or container licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/containerlicenses.html). See the linked websites for more information. 

In addition to the entitlements required for the Program directly, Licensee must obtain entitlements for this Program sufficient to cover the Virtual Processor Cores for the systems on which the resources managed or processed by the Program reside.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Entitlement Restrictions 

Licensee's entitlements to the Program, entitle Licensee only to use of the programs and functionality included with thatversion and release of the Program. Licensee's entitlements to this Program entitle Licensee to future versions of IBM Cloud Pak for Security that provide updated versions of existing programs and functionality included in this Program, but Licensee will not be entitled to any new programs and functionality provided as part of future versions and releases. Licensee must obtain entitlements specifically to such future versions and releases of IBM Cloud Pak for Security in order to deploy and use new programs and functionality.

If Licensee is using the Program to manage Resources on IBM Z, then entitlements may be calculated by converting Million Server Units (MSUs) to VPCs at a ratio of 1 VPC for every 1 MSU. An MSU is defined as one million Central Processing Unit (CPU) service units per hour; the measure of capacity used to describe the computing power of the hardware processors on which S/390 or System z software runs. MSU values are determined by the hardware vendor, IBM, or Software Compatible Vendors (SCVs). If Licensee is using the Program to manage IBM Security Guardium S-TAP on z/OS, then entitlements will be calculated by converting managed Guardium S-Tap Value Units (VU) to VPCs at a ratio of 2 VPC for every 1 VU.For MSU capacity by vendor and machine, see http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/resources/swprice/reference/exhibits/hardware.html.

For Programs which require keys to operate, Licensee may not have more keys to the Program in Licensee's Enterprise than Licensee has entitlements.



LICENSE INFORMATION

The Programs listed below are licensed under the following License Information terms and conditions in addition to the Program license terms previously agreed to by Client and IBM. If Client does not have previously agreed to license terms in effect for the Program, the International Program License Agreement (Z125-3301-14) applies.

Program Name (Program Number):
IBM Cloud Pak for Security (Gen 3) v1.8.0.0 (5737-L74)
IBM Cloud Pak for Security (Gen 3) Disaster Recovery (CU503139)

The following standard terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Limited use right

With the exception of Bundled Programs, all IBM software provided to Licensee with the Program can only be used to support Licensee's use of the Principal Program under this License Information document, which means such use must be directly related to a licensed use of the Principal Program.

Licensee is not authorized to use the Program to provide commercial IT services to any third party, to provide commercial hosting or timesharing, or to sublicense, rent, or lease the Program.

Prohibited Uses

Licensee may not use or authorize others to use the Program if failure of the Program could lead to death, bodily injury, or property or environmental damage.

License Terms delivered with Program Not Applicable

The terms of this Agreement supersede and void any electronic "click through," "shrinkwrap," or other licensing terms and conditions included with or accompanying the Program(s).

Bundled Programs

Licensee is authorized to install and use the Bundled Programs identified below. A Bundled Program may be accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to Licensee's use of that Bundled Program. In the event of conflict, the terms in this License Information document supersede the Bundled Program's terms. The Principal Program and any Bundled Programs are all part of the Program, as a whole. Therefore, Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements to the Program, as a whole, to cover Licensee's installation and use of all of the Bundled Programs, unless separate entitlements are provided within this License Information document. For example, if this Program were licensed on a VPC (Virtual Processor Core) basis and Licensee were to install the Principal Program or a Bundled Program on a 10 VPC machine and another Bundled Program on a second 10 VPC machine, Licensee would be required to obtain 20 VPC entitlements to the Program.

Licensee is solely responsible for ensuring that Licensee and Licensee's activities, applications and systems comply with all applicable laws, regulations, standards and practices. Use of this Program does not guarantee compliance with any law, regulation, standard or practice.

Separately Licensed Code

Each of the components listed in the NON_IBM_LICENSE file is considered "Separately Licensed Code" licensed to Licensee under the terms of the applicable third party license agreement(s) set forth in the NON_IBM_LICENSE file(s) that accompanies the Program, and not this Agreement. Future Program updates or fixes may contain additional Separately Licensed Code. Such additional Separately Licensed Code and related licenses are listed in the applicable NON_IBM_LICENSE file that accompanies the Program update or fix. 

Note: Notwithstanding any of the terms in the third party license agreement, the Agreement, or any other agreement Licensee may have with IBM, with respect to the Separately Licensed Code: 
(a) IBM provides it to Licensee WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE, AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE;
(b) IBM is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages including, but not limited to, lost data, lost savings, and lost profits.

Source Components and Sample Materials

The Program includes components in source code form ("Source Components"), or other materials identified as Sample Materials or both. Licensee may copy and modify Source Components and Sample Materials for internal use only within the limits of the license rights under this Agreement; provided, however, that Licensee may not alter or delete any copyright information or notices contained in the Source Components or Sample Materials. IBM provides the Source Components and Sample Materials without obligation of support and "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Program Keys

For Programs which require keys to operate, Licensee may not have more keys to the Program in Licensee's Enterprise than Licensee has entitlements.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Authorized User

Authorized User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An Authorized User is a unique person who is given access to the Program. The Program may be installed on any number of computers or servers and each Authorized User may have simultaneous access to any number of instances of the Program at one time. Licensee must obtain separate, dedicated entitlements for each Authorized User given access to the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. An entitlement for an Authorized User is unique to that Authorized User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the Authorized User entitlement to another person.

Events Per Second (EPS)

100, 500, 1K, and 2.5K Events Per Second are units of measure by which the Program can be obtained. An event is a log event generated from a server, application or device that can be processed for a specific purpose. Sufficient entitlements must be obtained to cover the maximum number of Events Per Second to be collected and processed by the Program at any time.

Flows Per Minute (FPM)

10K, 25K, 50K, and 100K Flows Per Minute are units of measure by which the Program can be obtained. A Flow is a record of communications between two hosts. All of the packets that contain the same source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, and protocol are combined to become one Flow record. Sufficient entitlements must be obtained to cover the maximum number of Flows Per Minute at any time.

Managed Virtual Server

Managed Virtual Server is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate server. A virtual server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a physical server or an unpartitioned physical server. Licensee must obtain Managed Virtual Server entitlements for each virtual server managed by the Program.

Resource Unit

Resource Unit is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. Resource Unit is an independent measure of a resource managed by, processed by, or related to the use of the Program. Sufficient entitlements must be obtained to cover every resource managed by, processed by, or related to the use of the Program.

Virtual Processor Core

Virtual Processor Core is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Physical Server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate Physical Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a Physical Server or an unpartitioned Physical Server. A Processor Core is a functional unit within a computing device that interprets and executes instructions. A Processor Core consists of at least one instruction control unit and one or more arithmetic or logic units. A Virtual Processor Core is a Processor Core in an unpartitioned Physical Server, or a virtual core assigned to a Virtual Server. Licensee must obtain entitlements for each Virtual Processor Core made available to the Program.

Licensee can deploy the Program (if supported) using full capacity licensing, sub-capacity licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/subcaplicensing.html), or container licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/containerlicenses.html). See the linked websites for more information. 

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Entitlement Restrictions 

Licensee's entitlements to the Program, entitle Licensee only to use of the programs and functionality included with thatversion and release of the Program. Licensee's entitlements to this Program entitle Licensee to future versions of IBM Cloud Pak for Security that provide updated versions of existing programs and functionality included in this Program, but Licensee will not be entitled to any new programs and functionality provided as part of future versions and releases. Licensee must obtain entitlements specifically to such future versions and releases of IBM Cloud Pak for Security in order to deploy and use new programs and functionality.

If Licensee is using the Program to manage Resources on IBM Z, then entitlements may be calculated by converting Million Server Units (MSUs) to VPCs at a ratio of 1 VPC for every 1 MSU. An MSU is defined as one million Central Processing Unit (CPU) service units per hour; the measure of capacity used to describe the computing power of the hardware processors on which S/390 or System z software runs. MSU values are determined by the hardware vendor, IBM, or Software Compatible Vendors (SCVs). If Licensee is using the Program to manage IBM Security Guardium S-TAP on z/OS, then entitlements will be calculated by converting managed Guardium S-Tap Value Units (VU) to VPCs at a ratio of 2 VPC for every 1 VU.For MSU capacity by vendor and machine, see http://www.ibm.com/systems/z/resources/swprice/reference/exhibits/hardware.html.
