savings arising out of the use or inability to use the Programs or any
component, even if Red Hat, its affiliates, an authorized distributor, and/or
licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall
Red Hat's or its affiliates' liability, an authorized distributor's liability or
the liability of the licensor of a component provided to you under this EULA
exceed the amount that you paid to Red Hat for the media under this EULA.

5. Export Control. As required by the laws of the United States and other
countries, you represent and warrant that you: (a) understand that the Programs
and their components may be subject to export controls under the U.S. Commerce
Department's Export Administration Regulations ("EAR"); (b) are not located in a
prohibited destination country under the EAR or U.S. sanctions regulations

Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be

1. License Grant. Subject to the following terms, Red Hat, Inc. ("Red Hat")
grants to you a perpetual, worldwide license to the Programs(each of which may

License v. 2.1. With the exception of certain image files identified in Section
2 below, each software component is governed by a license that permits you to
run, copy, modify, and redistribute (subject to certain obligations in some
cases) the software component. This EULA pertains solely to the Programs and

license terms applicable to any particular component.

2. Intellectual Property Rights. The Programs and each of their components are
owned by Red Hat and other licensors and are protected under copyright law and

trademark, the individual Program trademarks, and the "Shadowman" logo are
registered trademarks of Red Hat and its affiliates in the U.S. and other
countries. This EULA does not permit you to distribute the Programs using
Red Hat's trademarks, regardless of whether they have been modified. You may
make a commercial redistribution of the Programs only if (a) permitted under a
separate written agreement with Red Hat authorizing such commercial
redistribution or (b) you remove and replaced all occurrences of Red Hat
trademarks and logos. Modifications to the software may corrupt the Programs.
You should read the information found at
http://www.redhat.com/about/corporate/trademark/ before distributing a copy of

3. Limited Warranty. Except as specifically stated in this Section 3, a separate
agreement with Red Hat, or a license for a particular component, to the maximum
extent permitted under applicable law, the Programs and the components are
provided and licensed "as is" without warranty of any kind, expressed or
implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement
or fitness for a particular purpose. Red Hat warrants that the media on which

materials and manufacture under normal use for a period of 30 days from the date
of delivery to you. Neither Red Hat nor its affiliates warrant that the
functions contained in the Programs will meet your requirements or that the
operation of the Programs will be entirely error free, appear or perform
precisely as described in the accompanying documentation, or comply with
regulatory requirements. This warranty extends only to the party that purchases
subscription services for the Programs from Red Hat and/or its affiliates or a
Red Hat authorized distributor.

4. Limitation of Remedies and Liability. To the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law, your exclusive remedy under this EULA is to return any defective
media within 30 days of delivery along with a copy of your payment receipt and
Red Hat, at its option, will replace it or refund the money you paid for the
media. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, under no
circumstances will Red Hat, its affiliates, any Red Hat authorized distributor,
or the licensor of any component provided to you under this EULA be liable to
you for any incidental or consequential damages, including lost profits or lost
savings arising out of the use or inability to use the Programs or any
component, even if Red Hat, its affiliates, an authorized distributor, and/or
licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall
Red Hat's or its affiliates' liability, an authorized distributor's liability or
the liability of the licensor of a component provided to you under this EULA
exceed the amount that you paid to Red Hat for the media under this EULA.

5. Export Control. As required by the laws of the United States and other
countries, you represent and warrant that you: (a) understand that the Programs
and their components may be subject to export controls under the U.S. Commerce
Department's Export Administration Regulations ("EAR"); (b) are not located in a
prohibited destination country under the EAR or U.S. sanctions regulations
(currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Sudan and Syria, subject to change as
posted by the United States government); (c) will not export, re-export, or
transfer the Programs to any prohibited destination, persons or entities on the
U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security Denied Parties List or Entity List, or the
U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control list of Specially Designated Nationals and
Blocked Persons, or any similar lists maintained by other countries, without the
necessary export license(s) or authorizations(s); (d) will not use or transfer
the Programs for use in connection with any nuclear, chemical or biological
weapons, missile technology, or military end-uses where prohibited by an
applicable arms embargo, unless authorized by the relevant government agency by
regulation or specific license; (e) understand and agree that if you are in the
United States and export or transfer the Programs to eligible end users, you
will, to the extent required by EAR Section 740.17(e), submit semi-annual
reports to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, which
include the name and address (including country) of each transferee; and (f)
understand that countries including the United States may restrict the import,
use, or export of encryption products (which may include the Programs and the
components) and agree that you shall be solely responsible for compliance with
any such import, use, or export restrictions.

6. Third Party Programs. Red Hat may distribute third party software programs
with the Programs that are not part of the Programs. These third party software
programs are not required to run the Programs, are provided as a convenience to
you, and are subject to their own license terms. The license terms either
accompany the third party software programs or can be viewed at
http://www.redhat.com/licenses/thirdparty/eula.html. If you do not agree to
abide by the applicable license terms for the third party software programs,
then you may not install them. If you wish to install the third party software
programs on more than one system or transfer the third party software programs
to another party, then you must contact the licensor of the applicable third
party software programs.

7. General. If any provision of this EULA is held to be unenforceable, the
enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected. Any claim,
controversy or dispute arising under or relating to this EULA shall be governed
by the laws of the State of New York and of the United States, without regard to
any conflict of laws provisions. The rights and obligations of the parties to
this EULA shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on the
International Sale of Goods.

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

not met.
